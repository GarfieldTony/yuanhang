    Canada Long Voyage Seniors Recreations Society was officially registered as a non-profit organization with the Canadian federal government on December 12, 2021.

    Founding and First Event | 
    Just two months after our establishment, on February 12, 2022, we successfully hosted our first "Chinese New Year and Lantern Festival Gala." During the event, we introduced two original songs, Welcome to Long Voyage and Long Voyage Anthem, which reflect our core mission: to serve and bring happiness to overseas Chinese seniors. 
    Creation and Promotion of Original Works | 
    To celebrate Canada Day and the Platinum Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, we created the original song Beautiful Canada, expressing our love for our adopted country and our commitment to integrating into Canadian society. Additionally, we produced heartfelt works such as Missing Home and various Xinjiang ethnic songs and dances, enriching the cultural lives of seniors in the community.
